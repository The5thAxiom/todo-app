# todo-app

A basic todo app made using the MERN Stack.

# NOTE:

-   This is going to be built using the `MERN` stack.
-   I already know React, so the main focus of this repo is to learn the N, E and M i.e. NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB.
-   So, don't excpect this repo to have a working app anytime soon.
